    Args:

    """
    Applies rotary positional embeddings to query and key tensors in attention mechanisms.

    Rotary positional embeddings inject position-dependent rotations into query and key vectors,
    enabling transformers to encode positional information effectively without explicit positional encoding.

    Args:
        q (torch.Tensor): Query tensor with shape [batch_size, num_heads, seq_len, head_dim].
        k (torch.Tensor): Key tensor with shape [batch_size, num_heads, seq_len, head_dim].
        cos (torch.Tensor): Precomputed cosine positional embeddings with shape [batch_size, seq_len, head_dim].
        sin (torch.Tensor): Precomputed sine positional embeddings with shape [batch_size, seq_len, head_dim].
        unsqueeze_dim (int, optional): Dimension index to unsqueeze `cos` and `sin` to enable broadcasting.
                                      Defaults to 1 (typically the heads dimension).

    Returns:
        tuple[torch.Tensor, torch.Tensor]: The rotated query and key tensors (`q_embed`, `k_embed`), 
                                           each with the same shape as the input tensors.

    How it works:
        - `cos` and `sin` tensors are unsqueezed at `unsqueeze_dim` to broadcast across attention heads.
        - Rotary embeddings apply a complex number rotation in the embedding space using:
            rotated = (original * cos) + (rotate_half(original) * sin)
        - `rotate_half` performs a specific half-dimension rotation on the input tensor.
        - This operation encodes relative position information in q and k without adding explicit positional vectors.

    Example:
        q_embed, k_embed = apply_rotary_pos_embd(q, k, cos, sin)

    https://github.com/huggingface/smollm/blob/main/vision/m4/models/vllama3/modeling_vllama3.py#L382

            - For each transformer block, the input is processed along with
            rotary embeddings, attention mask, and optional cached key-values.
            - After processing all blocks, a final RMS normalization is applied.
            - If tokens are used, the normalized hidden states are projected to logits
            over the vocabulary.

            cache for efficient decoding.
